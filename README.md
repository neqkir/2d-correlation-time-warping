Wrote a Python lib for 2D signal processing using Correlation Time Warping based on 

**A Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Retention Time Alignment Algorithm To Enhance Chemometric Analysis of Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Separation Data, Karisa M. Pierce, Lianna F. Wood, Bob W. Wright, Robert E. Synovec, 2005**

Adapted the algorithm described in this article (1) replacing algo for 1D alignment with COW algorithm (2) adding an averaging trick.
